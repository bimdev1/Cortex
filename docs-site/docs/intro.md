# Introduction to Cortex

Welcome to **Cortex**, the multi-DePIN orchestration platform that makes decentralized computing accessible to everyone.

## What is Cortex?

Cortex is the "WordPress of distributed computing" - a platform that abstracts away the complexity of coordinating compute jobs across multiple decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs). Instead of learning five different APIs and managing separate accounts, you get one unified interface for all your decentralized computing needs.

## Why Cortex?

### 🌐 **Multi-Network Access**
Access compute resources from Akash Network, Render Network, Golem, Bittensor, and io.net through a single dashboard.

### 💰 **Massive Cost Savings**
Save 15-30x compared to traditional cloud providers by leveraging decentralized infrastructure pricing.

### ⚡ **Intelligent Routing**
Our platform automatically selects the best network based on your requirements for cost, performance, and availability.

### 📊 **Real-Time Monitoring**
Track job progress, costs, and network status with built-in dashboards and live updates.

### 🔒 **Enterprise Security**
Built with security-first principles, including atomic job commitment and Byzantine fault tolerance.

## How It Works

1. **Submit Jobs**: Use our simple interface to submit Docker containers for execution
2. **Network Selection**: Cortex intelligently routes your job to the optimal DePIN network
3. **Monitor Progress**: Track job status, costs, and performance in real-time
4. **Get Results**: Receive outputs and pay only for resources actually used

## Getting Started

Ready to deploy your first job? Check out our [Quick Start Guide](./getting-started/quick-start) to submit your first container in under 5 minutes.

For detailed setup instructions, see our [Installation Guide](./getting-started/installation).

## Architecture Overview

Cortex uses a novel atomic commitment protocol to coordinate jobs across multiple blockchain networks simultaneously. Learn more about our [technical architecture](./architecture/overview).
